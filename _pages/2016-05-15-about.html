<blockquote><p>Hi. I'm Sanaa.</p>
<p>I'm a dynamic macOS developer, with great attention to detail and a passion for generating compelling user experiences. I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.dashlane.com">Dashlane</a>. I have a strong interest in the latest technologies and focuses on getting the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dashlane-password-manager/id552383089?mt=12">Dashlane Mac application</a> to the next level.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Dashlane, I spent an exciting year at Apple Inc. where I was working as a Language Technology Engineer and a Mac OSX developer intern within the Siri team in Cupertino.</p>
<p>I hold a software engineering degree from the University of Technology of Compiègne in France and a two-year degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Sciences of Rabat in Morocco. Also, I did an exchange program at the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain.</p>
<p>I enjoy traveling internationally and when I'm not working, you are likely to find me at the gym or spending time with friends and family!</p></blockquote>
