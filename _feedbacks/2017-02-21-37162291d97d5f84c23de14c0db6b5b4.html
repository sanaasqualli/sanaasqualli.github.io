    RE: How I got into WWDC2016<br /><br />\n<b>Comment:</b> So I read your blog and
    I think it is super brave of you to include every step you took to achieve your
    dreams. I am a huge dreamer and I would love to be able to learn further about
    how you become who you are today and what pointers you would have for someone
    that seems to know what he's doing, but clearly needs constant advice. <br />\r\n<br
