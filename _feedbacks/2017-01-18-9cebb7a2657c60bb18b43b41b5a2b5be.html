    WWDC Scholarship<br /><br />\n<b>Comment:</b> Hi,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm Niall
    Kehoe and I'm 13 years old. I'm the youngest iOS App Developer in Europe. I have
    six apps on the App Store. This year I'm trying to win a WWDC Scholarship. The
    app I'm making is about me and my intrests since I heard that's what they usually
    ask for. My Apple works with Apple Watch and I hope to work on tv OS as well.
    I saw your article and was wondering what advice you might have for me.<br />\r\n<br
