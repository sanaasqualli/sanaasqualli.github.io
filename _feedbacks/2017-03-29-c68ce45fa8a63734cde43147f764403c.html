    WWDC<br /><br />\n<b>Comment:</b> Hello!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy name is Nasanbayar,
    and I'm writing this from Mongolia. I read the posts on your blog about the WWDC,
    and, I have to say, it really \"affected\" me in the best way. haha!<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nAs you've said, \"Let me know if you have any questions, I’ll be happy to
    answer them.\", I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about applying
    to the conference and some codes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm developing my own app
    called Equation Solver that solves systems of equations, quadratic equations with
    sines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents with showing the answer in different
    ways. However, I'm not sure whether I technically qualify for a good application.
    I would really want to talk to you through skype or viber or facebook messenger.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nI truly hope that you will be able to give me some advice.<br
