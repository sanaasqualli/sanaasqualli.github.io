<p>Recently, I won a scholarship for WWDC 2016. Since being asked several times how I managed to get the scholarship, I decided to write a post to share my experience with other people that might be interested.</p>
<p>Before I go into details I’ll start first with a short description of the conference.</p>
<h3><b>What’s WWDC?</b></h3>
<p>WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) is an annual conference held by Apple Inc. at the Moscone West convention center in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>The conference is a one-week event, bringing together several thousand developers from around the world.</p>
<p>It starts with a Keynote where Apple usually announces the future of their operating systems (OSX, iOS, watchOS and tvOS). During the week, developers can attend some valuable workshops and software sessions to learn and to practice how to use the latest Apple technologies. Also, there is a bash party to celebrate the week with WWDC new friends and music.</p>
<h3><b>How do you participate?</b></h3>
<p>WWDC tickets are allocated through random selection process due to limited availability.</p>
<p>Developers who want to attend must be a member of Apple Developer Program <b>before </b>the announcement day, and submit their registration by a deadline set by Apple. If they win the lottery, they will be charged $1599 for the ticket.</p>
<h3><b>What’s a WWDC Scholarship?</b></h3>
<p>Apple rewards 350 talented students and members of STEM* organizations with the opportunity to attend WWDC free of charge.</p>
<p>The winners are invited to an orientation day the Sunday prior the Keynote.</p>
<h3><b>Are you eligible for WWDC Scholarship?</b></h3>
<p>To be eligible for WWDC scholarship you have to be over 13 years old and a student or member of a STEM organization.</p>
<p>Developers have to be registered either under a free developer account or a paid Apple developer program.</p>
<p>They have to submit an application they have worked on that demonstrates a creative use of the latest Apple technologies.</p>
<p>Applications will be judged on technical accomplishment in the submitted application, the creativity of ideas in the submitted application, and quality of written responses to the questions in the application form.</p>
<p>Results of the application status are communicated one week after the submission deadline.</p>
<h3><b>My story</b></h3>
<p>I was rejected for the random selection process to attend WWDC 2016 by Apple. I knew there are other channels for getting a WWDC ticket. I believe life begins at the end of your comfort zone. Determined I did some research and I realized that I was actually eligible for a WWDC scholarship as a member of Women Who Code group.</p>
<p>I am a Mac OS X developer. For WWDC scholarship, despite the very short time (3 days) I had available before the submission deadline, I decided to take the challenge and develop my first iOS app solely in Swift.</p>
<p>This iOS app allows users to share their current location address with their friends.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-152" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshot1-576x1024.png" alt="screenshot1" width="394" height="700" /></p>
<p>It has a list and a map view history of all previously shared positions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-153" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshot2-1024x556.png" alt="screenshot2" width="885" height="480" /></p>
<p>The user can also keep track of how many times he shared a given location, re-view the address on a map or re-share it using Force touch.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-154 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshot3-1024x852.png" alt="screenshot3" width="640" height="533" /><br />
This app groups creative use of Apple technologies such as:<br />
Swift, Social Sharing, Maps, 3D Touch, Auto Layout, Core Animation and Core Data.</p>
<p>As this was my first iOS app, there were some challenges such as, How to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Swift correctly</li>
<li>Send information via Message, Social app .. and receive feedback.</li>
<li>Better use Auto Layout to support the different screens of iPhones.</li>
<li>Store, edit and update data on an iPhone.</li>
<li>Use 3D Touch features on iOS.</li>
<li>Integrate Maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading apple documentation and tutorials, I managed to overcome these technical challenges.</p>
<p>Developing an iOS app was very interesting for me, I’m proud of what I delivered in a very short time. I’m motivated to continue developing and improving it.</p>
<blockquote><p>The application is available on the App Store, you can download it from here <a href="https://appsto.re/fr/Tel0cb.i">Hoona on the App Store</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h3><b>Conclusion </b></h3>
<p>I continually push myself to learn the latest technologies to deliver innovative solutions.</p>
<p>I believe WWDC is an opportunity for a developer to stay up-to-date about iOS and Mac OS X technologies.</p>
<p>Getting a WWDC scholarship can be daunting for first-timers. Being proactive and focused is key.<br />
I encourage students and women who want to attend to WWDC to believe in themselves. There are prerequisites for the selection process. To ensure you are in with a chance, check you follow the requirement I described earlier.</p>
<p>Are you planning on applying for WWDC scholarship? Let me know if you have any questions, I’ll be happy to answer them.<br />
Please feel free to share your own experience in a comment, personal experience is always interesting to hear :)</p>
